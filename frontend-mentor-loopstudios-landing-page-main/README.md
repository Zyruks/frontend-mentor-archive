## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- GULP
- Vanilla Js
- Stylelint
- BEM
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is something i got from photoshop and i try on CSS and work the mix-blend-mode: multiply to get a slightly darker area of the picture with a gradient. Work just like i though.

if you want to check out the full class go to scss folder /layout/\_grid-gallery.scss

```
  background: linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    var(--clr-neutral-800) 0%,
    var(--clr-neutral-100) 100%
  );
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;

```

### Continued development

Doing more stuff with background properties. Got some ideas for new projects now.
