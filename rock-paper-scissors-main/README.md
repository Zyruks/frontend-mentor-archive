## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- CUBE CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla CSS
- Object Oriented
- Gulp

### What I learned

I have improve my knowledge in javascript classes and how to work with method more in depth.

I learn about the localStorage property. It was a requirement to maintain the score after refreshing or closing the tab was really intuitive but is the first time using it.

### Continued development

I want to improve the code and change the setTimeout for Promises but i need to read more about to implement this Object but soon this part gonna be complete too.
