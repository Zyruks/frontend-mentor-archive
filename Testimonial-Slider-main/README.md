### What I learned

is my first time trying to make a carrousel type of design and at first i try using position absolute for the second card and it work but card weren't align on the Y Axis. Them i try using Grid and putting the content on the same columns and move the second card with transform property.

Perfectly done ;)

## Acknowledgments

Is always good to keep a open mind on how to approach a design. Don't get stuck with the thing you already know and try new combinations.
